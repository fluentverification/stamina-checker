\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A copy of storm\+::builder\+::\+Explicit\+Model\+Builder with a max number of states to explore for debugging purposes

The model builder class which implements the STAMINA 2.\+5 algorithm (STAMINA 2.\+0/2.1 with dynamic programming)

Created by Josh Jeppson on Jun 9, 2021

Implementation for Stamina\+Model\+Builder methods.

Created by Josh Jeppson on 8/17/2021

The model builder class which implements the STAMINA 3.\+0 algorithm which uses a priority queue on the estimated reachability

Created by Josh Jeppson on Jun 9, 2021

The model builder class which implements the STAMINA 2.\+0 algorithm (no dynamic programming)

NOTE\+: This algorithm is here for testing purposes and benchmarking. It is NOT recommended to use this method

There are some benefits if only using one thread to using just the Stamina\+Model\+Builder class or Stamina\+Iterative\+Model\+Builder class. This class is used if and only if the threadcount is greater than 1.

Simply including threading makes it so that there is some nontrivial overhead in exploration, and we want to provide the users the option without having them have to have a control thread idling and waiting for the exploration thread.

Base class for all types of threads used by \mbox{\hyperlink{classstamina_1_1Stamina}{Stamina}}\textquotesingle{}s model builders

Created by Josh Jeppson on Jul 8, 2022

A type of thread which maintains the following responsibilities\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Keeps track of which thread owns a particular state
\item Allows for asynchronous requests for ownership of new states
\item Allows for unordered and asynchronous requests for transition matrix insertion
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Exploration threads can explore a state space with other threads, and will only explore threads that it owns.

Created by Josh Jeppson on Jul 8, 2022

An implementation of the Exploration\+Thread abstract class which uses the STAMINA iterative (2.\+0/2.5) algorithm.

Method implementations for \mbox{\hyperlink{classstamina_1_1Stamina}{Stamina}}

Created on 8/17/2021 by Josh Jeppson

Because state indecies are generally assigned in order, it is more efficient to allocate a linear array which guarantees a O(1) lookup time and has an (at worst) O(n / block\+Size) insert.

Blocksizes are assumed to be large

Implementation for Stamina\+Memory\+Pool methods

\mbox{\hyperlink{classstamina_1_1Stamina}{Stamina}} Memory Pool allocator

Because STAMINA/\+STORM allocates thousands or millions of states, and in C++ each call to {\ttfamily new} invokes a system-\/call, dynamic allocation of memory for stamina\+::\+Stamina\+Model\+Builder\+::\+Probability\+States are very slow. This allocates a pool of larger blocks to reduce the number of system-\/calls (since each call to malloc() -- invoked by new -- is a system call to ask for more memory)

This memory pool makes a few assumptions to increase performance\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item All states are assumed to be in memory from allocation-\/time until the program. The STAMINA memory pool allows for dynamic deletion, but defragmentation must be explicitly invoked using the defrag() method and is not automatically called.
\item For now, defrag() has not been implemented, requiring
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Future work\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Offload excess memory to a swapfile which is deleted on State\+Memory\+Pool destruction
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
